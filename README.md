Telegram Weather Bot

The Telegram Weather Bot is a simple bot built in Go that provides real-time weather updates directly within Telegram. It fetches weather data from an external API and delivers it in a user-friendly format.

This project was created as part of my journey to learn Go and understand how it interacts with external APIs.
